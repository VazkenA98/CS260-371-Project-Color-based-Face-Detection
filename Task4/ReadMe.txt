from our images we can see that with the rotation we will have different nested ellipsis, the bigger the rotation is, less nested Ellipsis we have. The Ellipsis in the ear area and in the lips area are most nested. By increasing the rotation angle we can see that ellipsis in lips area is getting smaller and smaller and may disappear and also in the area where Ellipsis indicate nose and central face is also clear when the rotation is less and again when we increase the rotation the ellipses in the central face is getting smaller and smaller and it may be disappear. Also we can conclude that by rotation the Ellipsis in the ears area is getting bigger if the rotation angle is big because the more rotation we have the ear ellipsis is getting located in the centroid. Finally we can conclude that we can detect the face Rotation by the Ellipsis and we can indicate on how much did the face rotate and that's by monitoring nested Ellipsis int he nose, ears and lips areas.
