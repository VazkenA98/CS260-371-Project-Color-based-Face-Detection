after applying all methods we can conclude that in the first method we can see the face boundaries are very obvious and what I mean by face boundaries is the layer 1, we can see the ears the boundaries of the face hairs and everything but the central face is not clear like second method. In the second method we see more central face and ears. In the second method we mostly see the layers through which is the ears and central face so we can conclude that by applying different method each method has its own effect on detection so the conclusion is that the first method is more likely to observe layer 1 and the second method is more likely to observe central face which is our layer 2
