We chose to apply mean filter with the radius equal to 5 and after that we extracted binary layers and follow up the all steps. We saw that we have small ellipsis in our image and this indicates that we have noises in it, so we follow up the same steps but after extracting binary layers we applied medium filter with radius equal to 5 on the extracted layers and after that we extracted the Ellipsis and merged the layers with OR operation and got the final image. here we can see a lot of ellipses. From layer one we have big circles on the ears and into the central face. For layer 2 we have nested ellipsis, we can see that we have an ellipsis in the ear area and also lips and above the lips in the nose part but the most nested ellipses are located in the lips area and that is our layer 3, as we can see the lips has the most nested ellipses which is our layer 3. comparing ellipsis from task 2 and task 3 we conclude that the task 3 has better results for nested ellipsis and OR operation and applying some filters before extracting our ellipsis has a significant effect on face detection and nested layer algorithm.
