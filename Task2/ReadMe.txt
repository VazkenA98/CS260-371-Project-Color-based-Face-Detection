Here after applying binary layer we convert each image into binary image and filled the holes after filling the holes we changed the look up table and after that we operated AND operation with layers 1 2 and 3 we set the measurements and eventually got the final image. From the final image we can see that we have multiple Ellipsis, a small ones and bigger ones for these small ones we tried to apply filter after extracting binary layers but eventually, we got two ellipses in our image that's why we didn't use any filters to get the final ellipses
